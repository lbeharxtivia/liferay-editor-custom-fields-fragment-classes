# Liferay Custom Fields Sample

Easy to access, enumerated classes for fragments

## Getting Started

This is meant to be imported into a client extension. Since this is the first app using the framework, it's already included as an example.

- In a terminal, navigate to your Liferay workspace's _client-extensions_ folder
- Clone the client extension into your folder using `git clone git@github.com:lbeharxtivia/liferay-editor-custom-fields-client-extension.git`
- Run `blade gw clean deploy` to deploy your new client extension
